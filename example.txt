DevOps is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration between development (Dev) and
 operations (Ops) teams to enhance the software delivery lifecycle. It integrates automation, continuous 
 integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), monitoring, and feedback loops to ensure faster, more reliable, 
 and efficient software releases. By leveraging tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and cloud services,
  DevOps aims to break down silos, improve scalability, and increase deployment frequency while maintaining stability
   and security. This approach fosters a culture of shared responsibility,
 enabling organizations to respond to market demands quickly and innovate with confidence.
